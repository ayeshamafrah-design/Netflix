## Project Overview
This project analyzes a Netflix dataset using Python to uncover patterns in content distribution, user preferences, and genre popularity. Insights were then visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Motivation
The goal of this analysis was to understand trends in Netflix's catalog, such as genre distribution, release patterns, and content popularity. This can inform business decisions in content creation and user engagement.

## Analysis and Methodology

Data Loading: Imported the Netflix dataset using Python (Pandas).
Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Content distribution by year, genre, and type.
Analysis of popular ratings and genre preferences.
Visualization: Created visualizations in Power BI to display findings interactively.
Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard includes the following key sections:

Content Distribution by Genre and Year
Popular Ratings and Duration Trends
Country-Wise Content Availability
You can interact with the dashboard to filter data by year, genre, or country.

## Installation
To run this project:

Clone this repository.
Install necessary Python packages (pandas, matplotlib, etc.).
Open the Power BI dashboard file (Netflix_Dashboard.pbix) to view the visualizations.

## Usage
This repository provides a Jupyter notebook with the Python code for data analysis, and a Power BI file for interactive visualization.
